This project analyzes heart disease data to identify risk factors and predictors of heart disease. The project includes a variety of visualizations, such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and forest plots, that can be used to identify relationships between different variables and heart disease.

## Solution:
An AI-powered heart disease analysis app utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze an individual's medical history, genetic profile, lifestyle habits, and wearable device data to provide personalized risk assessments and actionable insights for heart health improvement.

## Results:

- Enhanced personalized risk prediction: The app accurately predicts an individual's risk of developing heart disease, enabling early intervention and preventive measures to reduce the risk by up to 50%.

- Tailored lifestyle recommendations: The app provides personalized recommendations for lifestyle modifications, such as diet changes, exercise plans, and stress management techniques, to address individual risk factors and improve overall heart health.

- Empowered patient engagement: The app fosters patient engagement by providing clear and understandable explanations of risk factors, recommendations, and progress tracking, empowering individuals to take charge of their heart health.
